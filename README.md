## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework

### What I learned

I've never use tailwindcss before. That is why I chose it for this project. I found it really great for responsive design
I learnt the basics and I would like to get better at it. 


### Continued development

Responsive design
